This is a project i created a few years ago. It uses Vue 2 as a Frontend library, as well as PHP for the backend parts. 
I consider every file in this project as legacy code, because i used it to learn PHP and Vue 2. Everything in this project is written by myself (design included). 
I would solve many things differently nowadays.
